# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project was developed using Excel with a database that was provided in Data Analytics Boot Camp by Tecnologico de Monterrey
### Purpose
The main purpose of this analysis is to get a view of how proyects in the theater industry behave around the world and to visualize trends and correlations of the behaviour that they might have in relation with their launch date and the amount of money they established as a goal. 
## Analysis and Challenges
In order to excecute this analysis I used the data base that was provided and convert it to a normal table, that way I could visualize my information better, afterwards I created a pivot table to tell excel exactly what I wanted to look at, after getting the results in a decent order I inserted a line graph which was linked to my pivot table, in this graph we're able to see the 3 posible outcomes of the proyect and how they behave according to the season. Then I worked with the numbers of outcomes and their results according to the goal that was established, and for this I worked with Countifs formulas which where dependant on the goal that was set and the outcome of the proyect, after this table was ready I inserted a line graph to visualize the % of total proyects that was successfull, fail or canceled depending on the established goal. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By looking at the Outcomes based on Launch date graph for the Theater industry over the year we can conclude that May is the month with the highest percentage of success of the total proyects, also the best quarter of the year in terms of successfull proyects is the second quarter, while the last quarter and end of the year tends to have the worst performance.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
By looking at this chart I was able to identify that the proyects that have the lower goal are the ones that tend to be the more successful while the ones with the highest have the biggest amount of failures but also this is no a linear conclusion since those which goal is from 25000 to 45000 show a positive success tendency but after passing this amount the rates of success crash drastically.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
In order to get some extra intell on the industry I decided to create a sheet called Descriptive statistics which shows some simple stadistic functions and how they behave according to the country and subcategory, I struggle doing this formulas because i wanted my data to be moved according to the filters therefore I had to use subtotals but not all of the functions that I wanted to use have them so I created some that where more complex which compensate the lack of subtotals.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The second quarter of the year is the best period of success in the theater industry while the fourth is the worst.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The proyects with the lowest goal tend to have more success and those with the highest have the highest failure rates, but there's not a linear tendency within this since the second group with the highest goal tend to have a better success rate than the second lowest.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The presence of outliers could be making my information biased
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could have stadistical functions to see some other perspective, using histographs could be helpfull for identifying the just mentioned outliers.
